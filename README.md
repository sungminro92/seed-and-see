# SEED & SEE

SEED & SEE websites is educational garden plan for children. I planned this so that Chiildren involve in nature-friendly activities both online and in real life! Major activities children user can experience is: planning & managing current garden with automatic watering schedule alerts, share interesting facts and events about their garden to news feed & communicate through comments, search for nutrition facts about any kind of food and ingredients, and lastly learn about the importance of life!
